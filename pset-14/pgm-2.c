/*
Program #2
Stack Extensions
Implement a stack based on code found in Section 13.5 of the book, include the
push and pop functions.  Use a loop to read characters from stdin using the
getchar() function.  Push each character entered into a stack.  Have the loop
exit when the user enters a newline ('\n') character.

Using the pop() function, output the stack of characters in reverse order:

Enter a string: Hello world!

Reversed: !dlrow olleH
Your code for the stack must include a data node that uses a pointer as a link
to another data node.

Hint: You may want to implement an isEmpty function for the stack; alternately,
we know that a stack is empty when the top of it is NULL.
