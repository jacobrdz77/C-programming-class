Program #3
Compound Interest and Payments
You have saved $500 to use as a down payment on a car. Before beginning your car shopping, you decide to write a program to help you figure out what your monthly payment will be, given the carâ€™s purchase price, the monthly interest rate, and the time period over which you will pay back the loan. The formula for calculating your payment is

                                                  image.png

where

P = principal (the amount you borrow)
i = monthly interest rate (1/12  of the annual rate)
n = total number of payments
Your program should prompt the user for the purchase price, the annual interest rate, and the total number of payments (usually 36, 48, or 60). It should then display the amount borrowed and the monthly payment including a dollar sign and two decimal places.

TEST your Program for the following problem:
You just bought a cool Red F150 Truck for $40,000.
Compute your monthly payments for the financing options:
  (1) 60 months @ 4.20% APR
  (2) 48 months @ 4.20% APR 
  (3) 36 months @ 4.54% APR
